For homework6 I was tasked with creating a functioning weather dashboard. The following functions are working properly.

* Functioning current day tracker
* Is able to track different cities
* Shows Temp, Wind Speed, Humidity and UV Index

These functions are not wokring properly as of turning in.

* Five day dashboard does not pull up
* A single Javascript funtion on line 72 does not appear to work now
